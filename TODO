* implement non-RPS balancing (requires some performance testing)

* balance non-NIC IRQs

* implement other strategy, which uses less CPUs

* when not daemonizing log lines have two newlines

* use sysfs to read CPU info (road to 'CPU hotplug')

* make configurable

* configuration: ban some IRQs?
