* implement non-RPS balancing (requires some performance testing)

* balance non-NIC IRQs

* implement other strategy, using less CPUs

* when not daemonizing log some lines have two newlines

* use sysfs to read CPU info (road to 'CPU hotplug')

* automake: add libnl version check

* configuration: ban some IRQs?
