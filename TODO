* use bison %locations

* IRQs: since introducing split RX/TX IRQs check the IRQ stats
  if they are still correct

* use SIGHUP for reconfiguration

* config: specifying an invalid range does not give an error

* load strategies from DSO, allowing to make the balancing
  decision dependant on system configuration.

* strategy "static" { }: make empty curly braces optional

* balance non-NIC IRQs

* implement other strategy, using less CPUs

* use sysfs to read CPU info (road to 'CPU hotplug')

* automake: add libnl version check

* configuration: ban some IRQs?
